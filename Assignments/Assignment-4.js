// Day4 JavaScript Questions:-

// 1. Create the Example for Logical Operators?
// Ans:-  Three type of Logical Operators.
//     1. And Operator(&&)
//     2. Or Operator(||)
//     3. Not Operator(~)

// Ex- let a = 30;
//     console.log("Number is divisible by both (3 and 5) : ", a%3==0 && a%5==0);

// 2. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
// Ans:-"==" it is only compare the two value.
//      "===" it is compare the two value and also check its data type.

// 3. How many operators do we have in JS?
// Ans:- There are various types of JavaScript operators.

// 1-Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. (+, -, *, /, %, ++, --)

// 2-Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)

// 3-Comparison Operators: Compare values and return true or false (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)

// 4-Logical Operators: Perform logical operations (&&, ||, !)

// 5-Bitwise Operators: Perform operations on binary representations of numbers (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>)

// 6-Unary Operators: Operate on a single operand (+, -, ++, --, !)

// 7-Conditional (Ternary) Operator: A shorthand for an if-else statement (condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse)

// 8-String Operators: Concatenate strings (+)

// These operators allow you to perform different tasks like math, comparisons, logical operations, and more within JavaScript code.


// 4. What is use of parseInt in js?
// Ans:- It is converted to the value in number or Integer.

// 5. Take input from user and find the odd and even number.
// Ans:- let a = Number(prompt("Enter the number"));
//       console.log((a%2==0) ? "Number is Even" : "Number is odd");
